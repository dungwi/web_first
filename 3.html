  <h2>JavaScript</h2>
  <p style="margin-top:30px;"><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/ko/docs/Web/JavaScript" target="_blank" title="JavaScript Tutorial"><strong>JavaScript</strong></a>, often abbreviated as JS, is a back-end server-side programming language which is often called ECMAScript.[10] JavaScript is high-level, often just-in-time compiled, and multi-paradigm. It has curly-bracket syntax, dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions.</p>

  <p style="margin-top:20px;">Alongside HTML and CSS, JavaScript is one of the core technologies of the World Wide Web.[11] Over 97% of websites use it client-side for web page behavior,[12] often incorporating third-party libraries.[13] All major web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine to execute the code on the user's device.</p>

  <p style="margin-top:20px;">As a multi-paradigm language, JavaScript supports event-driven, functional, and imperative programming styles. It has application programming interfaces (APIs) for working with text, dates, regular expressions, standard data structures, and the Document Object Model (DOM).</p>

  <p style="margin-top:20px;">The ECMAScript standard does not include any input/output (I/O), such as networking, storage, or graphics facilities. In practice, the web browser or other runtime system provides JavaScript APIs for I/O.</p>

  <p style="margin-top:20px;">JavaScript engines were originally used only in web browsers, but they are now core components of other software systems, most notably servers and a variety of applications.</p>

  <p style="margin-top:20px;">Although there are similarities between JavaScript and Java, including language name, syntax, and respective standard libraries, the two languages are distinct and differ greatly in design.</p>
